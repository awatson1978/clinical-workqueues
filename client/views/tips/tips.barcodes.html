        <p>Don't worry about the barcodes.  Every person has a unique ID, and that's all that represents.  Most of the time, you won't ever need to worry about them.</p>
        <p>Trick:  You can copy-and-paste the barcode into another application, and it will appear as a string of numbers:  *huTedtfm6ifbFAj2A*</p>
        <p>Trick:  You can put barcodes into a searchbar to search for that unique ID.</p>
