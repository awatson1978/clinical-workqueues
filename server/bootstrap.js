// BegoÃ±a is one of the best anatomists and medical illustrators I've ever had the opportunity to work with. In an age where people get distracted by the glitz and flash of the technical aspects of medical illustration and scientific visualization, she has an ability to focus in on the content of production unlike anybody else. Her attention to anatomical detail is simply masterful; at a level that I didn't know people even worked at. Not only is she a walking anatomy textbook, she networks with other professionals effortlessly, and is in the know on the latest industry trends ranging from telomere medications to 3D anatomical printing. Add to that a simply delightful personality that lights up whatever room she's in, and the result is a coworker who will be sorely missed. Do yourself a favor, and sponsor her for an H1B visa already!!
